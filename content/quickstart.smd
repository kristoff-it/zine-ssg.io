## 1. Get Zine

[Download Zine](https://github.com/kristoff-it/zine/releases/) for your platform. 

If instead you prefer compiling from [source](https://github.com/kristoff-it/zine/), you will need [Zig](https://ziglang.org).


## 2. Init a new Zine site

**`shell`**
```bash
$ mkdir example.com
$ cd example.com
$ zine init
```
Running `zine init` will create all the files required to get a Zine site up and running.

The Zine sample site will contain a couple basic pages and two already made sections: 
- a blog 
- a devlog

The devlog is a form of microblogging powered by Zine's expressive templating system where you add new entries not by creating new pages (like in a blog), but rather by adding a new paragraph within a single content page. The devlog has its own
dedicated RSS feed where every post has a separate entry.

[Zine has a devlog](/log/) as well, and a few other projects are also starting to adopt 
this communication format. If you too are developing an Open Source project,
or just like microblogging, consider giving it a try as a zen alternative to mainstream social media platforms.

## 3. Get developer tooling
This step is optional but **strongly** recommended as it will give you access
to syntax highlighting, autoformatting and language server diagnostics for your
editor.

If you have VSCode, install `Ziggy`, `SuperMD` and `SuperHTML` from the VSCode 
Extensions tab (the right extensions are all from `Loris Cro`).

If you don't use VSCode, see the [Editor support](/docs/editors/) section.

## Start editing your Zine site

Run `zine` (without subcommand) to start the development server and begin editing
your new Zine site. 

Every time you save a file, the dev server will automatically
rebuild the site and reload your browser page.

To learn more about Zine, [see the docs section]($link.page('docs')).
