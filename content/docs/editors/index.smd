## About
Zine uses three languages that you will want to add support for in your editor:
- [Ziggy](https://ziggy-lang.io)
- [SuperMD](https://github.com/kristoff-it/supermd)
- [SuperHTML](https://github.com/kristoff-it/superhtml)

There are two main components for each that you will want to setup: 

- **Syntax highlighting**  
  *(mostly provided through tree sitter grammars)*
- **Language Server support**  
  *(mostly provided through CLI tools)*

Both Tree Sitter grammars and prebuilt releases of each language's CLI tool are 
available at the links above, but first make sure to follow the instructions 
specific to your editor.

># [Note]($block)
>The SuperHTML CLI tool is also a language server for regular HTML files.


## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues while setting up your editor, [join the community](/community) and ask for help.

Make sure to have all the CLI tools available in your `PATH` to enable LSP support.

## Other editors

We welcome contributions that add support for Zine file formats to editors 
(or just instructions of how to perform manual setup).
