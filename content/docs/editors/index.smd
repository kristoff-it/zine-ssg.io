## About
Zine uses three languages that you will want to add support for in your editor:
- [Ziggy](https://ziggy-lang.io)
- [SuperMD](https://github.com/kristoff-it/supermd)
- [SuperHTML](https://github.com/kristoff-it/superhtml)

There are two main components for each that you will want to setup: 

- **Syntax highlighting**  
  *(mostly provided through tree sitter grammars)*
- **Language Server support**  
  *(mostly provided through CLI tools)*

Both Tree Sitter grammars and prebuilt releases of each language's CLI tool are 
available at the links above, but first make sure to follow the instructions 
specific to your editor.

># [Note]($block)
>The SuperHTML CLI tool is also a language server for regular HTML files.


## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues while setting up your editor, [join the community](/community) and ask for help.

# Editors

## VSCode
- [SuperMD Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LorisCro.supermd)
- [SuperHTML Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LorisCro.super)
  - The extension bundles a WASM build of the Language Server, so you won't need
    to install the CLI tool to use it.

## Neovim
[See the Neovim dedicated page](./neovim).

## Helix
[See the Helix dedicated page](./helix).


## Flow Control
[Flow Control](https://flow-control.dev/) has native support for all Zine file formats.

Make sure to have all the CLI tools available in your `PATH` to enable LSP support.

## Other editors
Any editor that supports Tree Sitter for syntax highlighting and the Language Server Protocol can be setup to support Ziggy, SuperMD, and SuperHTML.

We welcome contributions that add support for Zine file formats to editors 
(or just instructions of how to perform manual setup).
