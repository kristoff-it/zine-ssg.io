# Main configuration file 

A Zine website is defined by a `zine.ziggy` config file.

Here's what the config of `zine-ssg.io` looks like:

***`zine.ziggy`***
```ziggy
Site {
   .title = "Zine - Static Site Generator",
   .host_url = "https://zine-ssg.io",
   .content_dir_path = "content",
   .layouts_dir_path = "layouts",
   .assets_dir_path = "assets",
   .static_assets = [
      // omitted for brevity
   ],
}
```
Once you put a `zine.ziggy` file in a directory, you're able to run `zine` to 
start the dev server and begin to edit your website.


## File formats used by Zine
Zine uses [SuperMD]($link.page('docs/supermd')) for content and [SuperHTML]($link.page('docs/superhtml')) for defining layouts.

- File extensions:
  - SuperMD: `.smd`
  - SuperHTML: `.shtml`

Each file format has a dedicated page in the docs section.

# The Content Directory

The content directory contains your SuperMD files and their structure will be 
reflected verbatim in the final site.

- `content/index.smd`  
  is the main index page of your website 
  - (i.e. `https://site.com/`).
- `content/about.smd`  
  will generate `/about/index.html` 
  - (i.e. `https://site.com/about/`)
- `content/foo/index.smd`  
  will generate `/foo/index.html` 
  - (i.e. `https://site.com/foo/`)
- `content/foo/bar.smd`  
  will generate `/foo/bar/index.html` 
  - (i.e. `https://site.com/foo/bar/`)

Note that SSGs rely heavily on the implication that webservers will 
automatically serve `index.html` when a directory (usually indicated 
by a final `/` in the URL) is requested. 

## Site Sections
Consider the following content structure:
```
content
├── about
│   └── contacts.smd
├── about.smd
├── blog
│   ├── a.smd
│   ├── b.smd
│   └── index.smd
└── index.smd
```
**In Zine every `index.smd` file denotes a section.**

The main use for sections is to group pages together for the purpose of defining
content lists, like [listing]($link.sibling("superhtml/scripty").ref("Page.subpages"))
all posts in a blog section, for example.


In this example there are 2 sections: 

The first one is the "root" section, defined by `content/index.smd`, containing:

- `about/contacts.smd`
- `about.smd`
- `blog/index.smd`

The second section is the "blog" section, defined by `content/blog/index.smd`, containing:

- `blog/a.smd`
- `blog/b.smd`

Note how an `index.smd` file defines a section but as a page it is not included
in the list of pages that belong to that same section.

Lastly, note how pages in a section don't all share the same basepath. In the
absence of a nested `index.smd`, all pages are considered siblings regardless of
how deeply they are nested inside of different directories.


## Frontmatter
Each SuperMD file must start with a Ziggy frontmatter delimited by `---` (three
dashes in a row).

Ziggy is a data serialization language similar to YAML and JSON. You can
learn more on the official Ziggy website: 
[https://ziggy-lang.io](https://ziggy-lang.io).

**`index.smd`** 
```ziggy
---
.title = "Homepage",
.date = @date("2020-07-06T00:00:00"),
.author = "Sample Author",
.layout = "home.shtml",
.draft = false,
--- 
Your **SuperMD** content goes here.
```

Some fields, like `title`, and `layout` are mandatory, while others have default values. You can find a complete list of  
[frontmatter fields]($link.page('docs/supermd/').ref('frontmatter')) 
in the SuperMD documentation page.

A very important required field is `layout`. This field must point at the layout
that you want to use to style your content. In Zine this field must always be
explicitly filled out and there is no implicit naming convention (like in Hugo,
for example).

# The Layouts Directory
Layouts are used to style your content files. You can learn more about layouts 
in the [SuperHTML Basics](superhtml) section.

# The Assets Directory

This directory collects various assets (images, css files, etc) necessary to
build the website. Note that unlike other mainstream static site generators,
Zine doesn't have a "static" asset folder as all assets are managed explicitly
through Zine's [Asset System]($link.page('docs/assets')).


# First Steps

The quickest way to start a Zine site is to run `zine init`, which will generate a sample site for you.

In this section we will instead go through the motions of bootstrapping a Zine website entirely from scratch.

First of all you need to create a `zine.ziggy` file and place it in an empty directory. The `zine.ziggy` file must be structured like the one at the top of this page.


Once that's done, let's create a homepage and a relative template.

**`shell`**
```
$ touch content/index.smd
$ touch layouts/home.shtml
```

**`content/index.smd`** 
```ziggy
---
.title = "Home",
.date = @date("2020-07-06T00:00:00"),
.author = "Sample Author",
.layout = "home.shtml",
.draft = false,
--- 
Hello World!
```

**`layouts/home.shtml`**
```superhtml
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title :text="$site.title"></title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1 :text="$page.title"></h1>
    <div :html="$page.content()"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```


**`public/index.shtml (output)`** 
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Sample Site</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Home</h1>
    <div><p>Hello World!</p></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

In this example we just saw:
- `index.smd` defines that its layout is `home.shtml`
- `home.shtml` defines some HTML and uses 
   [special attributes]($link.page('docs/superhtml').ref('attributes')) 
   to pull in the contents of `index.smd` 
- the final output is going to be the homepage of our website 

If you start the dev server now by running `zine`, you should see the output page at `http://localhost:1990/`.

### Adding more pages

Let's imagine now that we want to add a blog section to our website with a first post in it.

**`shell`**
```bash
$ mkdir content/blog
$ touch content/blog/first-post.smd
$ touch layouts/post.shtml
```

**`content/blog/first-post.smd`**
```ziggy
---
.title = "First Post!",
.date = @date("2020-07-06T00:00:00"),
.author = "Sample Author",
.layout = "post.shtml",
.draft = false,
--- 
This is my first post!
```

**`layouts/post.shtml`**
```superhtml
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title :text="$site.title"></title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Blog</h1>
    <h2 :text="$page.title"></h2>
    <h3>by <span :text="$page.author"></span></h3>
    <h4>
      Posted on: 
      <span 
        :text="$page.date.format('January 02, 2006')"
      ></span>
    </h4>
    <div :html="$page.content()"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

At this point you should be able to navigate to
`http://localhost:1990/blog/first-post/` and see the result.

Note how we needed a new layout (`post.shtml`) since the blog post is not
going to have the same structure as the homepage.

While the structure is indeed different, both `post.shtml` and `home.shtml`
share a lot of common boilerplate that can be collected into a single template by leveraging SuperHTML template extension features.

You can learn more about extending templates in the docs section dedicated to SuperHTML.



# Multilingual sites

In this page we showed you the structure of a simple Zine website, but it's 
also possible to use Zine to generate multilingual websites. 

You can learn more about that in the [Multilingual (i18n)](i18n) section.
