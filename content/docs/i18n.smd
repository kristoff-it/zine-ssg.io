## Creating Multilingual Websites 

To create a multilingual website, use `multilingualWebsite` in your
`build.zig`, like in the following example.

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const zine = @import("zine");

pub fn build(b: *std.Build) !void {
    zine.multilingualWebsite(b, .{
        .host_url = "https://kristoff.it",
        .layouts_dir_path = "layouts",
        .assets_dir_path = "assets",
        .i18n_dir_path = "i18n",
        .localized_variants = &.{
            .{
                .locale_code = "en-US",
                .output_prefix_override = "",
                .title = "Loris Cro's Blog",
                .content_dir_path = "content/en-US",
            },

            .{
                .locale_code = "it-IT",
                .title = "Loris 🤌 Cro's 🤌 Blog",
                .content_dir_path = "content/it-IT",
            },
        },
    });
}
```
## Localized variants
Each variant can define the following fields:

#### `locale_code`
A `language-NATION` string, e.g. `en-US`, `en-UK`, `it-IT`, `ja-JP`.

#### `title`
Site title for this variant.

#### `content_dir_path` 
Content directory with localized versions of your content.

#### `host_url_override` (optional)
The default assumption in Zine is that all your localized variants will be
deployed on the same host, with each localization made available under a `locale_code` prefix:

- `https://site.com/en-US/about/`
- `https://site.com/it-IT/about/`

Some users might want instead to serve each localization from a different hostname:

- `https://us.site.com/about/`
- `https://it.site.com/about/`

Setting `host_url_override` for each localized variant will make Zine generate
permalinks accordingly. 

#### `output_prefix_override` (optional)
This field can be used to override the path prefix for a localized variant.
When `host_url_override` is set to null, the default prefix for each localized
variant is `locale_code`. When `host_url_override` is set to a non-null value,
the default prefix is `""` (empty string).

You can set `output_prefix_override` to any string to place a localized variant
under an arbitrary prefix. Setting it to an empty string is a good way of creating
a "default variant" of the website.

For example by setting `ouptput_prefix_override` to empty string in `en_US` this
is the resulting site layout:

- `https://site.com/about/`
- `https://site.com/it-IT/about/`


Here's a table with more examples:


|  output prefix override |     host url override     |     resulting url prefix    |      output prefix     |
| :------: | :-----------: | :--------------- | :-------------- |
|   null   |      null     | /en-US/  | zig-out/en-US/  |
|   null   | "us.site.com" | /        | zig-out/en-US/  |
|   "foo"  |      null     | /foo/    | zig-out/foo/    |
|   "foo"  | "us.site.com" | /foo/    | zig-out/foo/    |
|    ""    |      null     | /        | zig-out/        |


## The i18n Directory
When creating a multilingual website, the assumption is that the same layouts
and site assets will be reused across all localized variants, while the 
content folder will vary for each. 

># [NOTE]($block)
>To have per-variant assets you can both create appropriate subdirectories
>in your site assets directory and also leverage page-local assets.


Varying the content folder will allow you to create different localizations of 
your content, but that alone is not enough to provide localizedd versions of 
your site.

The `i18n` directory must contain a Ziggy file for each of your localized variants
that will then be made available in order to provide localizations for phrases 
present in your layouts.

Localized variants and their Ziggy file are matched using the `locale_code` field.

**`$ tree i18n`**
```
i18n
├── en-US.ziggy
└── it-IT.ziggy
```

Each file contains a Ziggy map that can then be accessed from your layouts as `$i18n`.

**`$ cat i18n/it-IT.ziggy`**
```ziggy
{
 "back2top": "Ritorna in cima",
 "hello": "Ciao {}!",
}
```

Normal Scripty builtin functions are perfect for basic access to translations in layouts.

***`error if phrase is missing`***
```html
<a href="#top" :text="$i18n.get('back2top')"></a>
```

***`default value fallback`***
```html
<a href="#top" :text="$i18n.getOr('back2top', 'Top')"></a>
```

***`render element only if the phrase is present`***
```html
<div :if="$i18n.get?('back2top')">
  <a href="#top" :text="$if"></a>
</div>
```

***`format the phrase (fmt is a string function)`*** 
```html
<p :text="$i18n.get('hello').fmt($page.author)"></p>
```

### Discovering localizations
To discover other localized variants for the same page, you can use 
`$page.locales()`.

Refer to the 
[SuperHTML Scripty reference]($link.page('docs/superhtml/scripty')) 
to see how to use the resulting value.

Consider the following directory structure:

```
content
├── en-US
│   ├── about.smd
│   ├── docs
│   │   └── index.smd
│   └── index.smd
└── it-IT
    ├── about.smd
    ├── pasta.smd
    ├── docs.smd
    └── index.smd
```

- `index.smd` and `about.smd` are both respectively matched with their corresponding variant because they have the same path (i.e. 
  `en-US/about.smd`, `it-IT/about.smd`). 
- `pasta.smd` is not matched with any other page because it has a unique relative 
path.
- `docs.smd` is not matched with any other page because, even though the resulting
url path would be the same as `docs/index.smd`, the *content path* is different.

That said, it is possible to match any page with any other by setting `translation_key` in the Ziggy frontmatter of each page.

This last way of matching pages is meant to be used when URL paths are also localized,
for example:

- `https://site.com/en-US/contact-us/`
- `https://site.com/it-IT/contattaci/`

The following frontmatter key must be set in both "contact us" pages:
```ziggy
.translation_key = "contact page"
```

The translation key can be any string value, as long as it is unique per each localized variant.
