# [RSS feed]($section.id('rss'))
Zine doesn't have direct knowledge of RSS feeds but by combining a handful of
its features you can add support for the most syndication formats commonly used.

In this example we'll assume that we want to generate an RSS feed for a blog.

## 1. Define an alternative for the post listing page
Your blog should have a page that lists all posts. We'll generate the RSS feed
as an alternative version of it.

If you think about it, this is the semantically correct thing to do, since an 
RSS feed *is* an alternative version of a page that lists your posts.

**`posts.smd` (in the frontmatter)**
```
---
.alternatives = [{
  .name = "rss",
  .type = "application/rss+xml",
  .layout = "rss.xml",
  .output = "index.xml",
}],
---
```

## 2. Create the XML layout
SuperHTML doesn't support XML officially yet, but there is enough support to
generate correct feeds.

This is a RSS2.0 example but you can also do the same with Atom, if you prefer.

**`rss.xml`**
```html
<rss version="2.0">
 <channel>
  <title>My blog</title>
  <link>https://site.com/</link>
  <description>Recent content</description>
  <generator>Zine -- https://zine-ssg.io</generator>
  <language>en-us</language>
  <lastBuildDate :text="$build.generated.formatHTTP()"></lastBuildDate>
  <ctx :loop="$page.subpages()">
   <item>
    <title :text="$loop.it.title"></title>
    <link :text="$site.host_url.addPath($loop.it.link())"></link>
    <pubDate :text="$loop.it.date.formatHTTP()"></pubDate>
    <guid :text="$site.host_url.addPath($loop.it.link())"></guid>
   </item>
  </ctx>
 </channel>
</rss>
```

## 3. Link to your RSS feed

### In SuperMD

Same page:
```md
[Follow my RSS feed]($link.alternative('rss'))
```
Different page (see the reference docs for more variations):
```md
[Follow my RSS feed]($link.page('other/page').alternative('rss'))
```

### In SuperHTML
```html
<ctx alt="$page.alternative('rss')">
  <a href="$ctx.alt.link()" type="$ctx.alt.type">
    RSS feed
  </a>
</ctx>
```

# [Preserve old links]($section.id('old-links'))
You're porting your website to Zine but still want to make sure old links don't
break?

Use the `aliases` field in the page's 
[frontmatter]($link.sibling('supermd').ref('frontmatter')) 
to define a second copy (or more) of the page that can be placed at any 
location you'd like.

If your old site used so-called *ugly URLs* (i.e. `foo.md` would become `foo.html` instead of `foo/index.html`), then this is your only option since
Zine has no support for ugly URLs at the moment.
