# [Assets in Zine]($section.id('assets-in-zine'))
A Zine site can have 3 kinds of assets: **site**, **page**, and **build** assets.

># [Note]($block)
>SuperMD and SuperHTML have different ways of accessing assets, make sure to 
>read their respective documentation pages.

# [Site Assets]($section.id('site-asset'))
These assets are located under `assets_dir_path`. 

In SuperHTML, the main way of accessing site assets is by accessing them through an instance of Site: `$site.asset('logo.png')`.

Once you have an `Asset`, the main way to use it is by `link`ing it:

- `$site.asset('logo.png').link()`


**Calling `link` on an asset will cause Zine to install it in the output directory.** 
Conversely, accessing an asset *without* calling `link` on it will **not** cause it to be installed.

># [SuperMD]($block)
>In SuperMD you can reference assets using the appropriate functions of `$link.siteAsset()`,
>`$image.siteAsset()` or `$video.siteAsset()`. Referencing an asset in SuperMD will cause it to be 
>installed just like it does for SuperHTML.

The SuperHTML Scripty reference page lists all other operations that can be performed on instances of `Asset`. 

One example of where this makes sense is when you have a Ziggy (or JSON) document that you want to use to build a page, but that is not meant to be included the final output.

**`songs-list.shtml`**
```html
<ul :loop="$page.asset('songs.json').ziggy()">
  <li :text="$loop.it.get('name')"></li>
</ul>
```

># [NOTE]($block) 
>Zine uses [Ziggy](https://ziggy-lang.io) as its data serialization 
>format of choice, but JSON documents happen to be a valid subset of Ziggy, so 
>you can use them directly. 


## [Static Site Assets]($section.id('static-assets'))
Some assets should be installed even if no layout or page refers to them. 

For example `favicon.ico` might not be referenced, but browsers will automatically try to fetch it.

Another example could be [`.well-known`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_URI) assets or files that might have special meaning for the hosting service that you're using. 

For example, GitHub uses a file named `CNAME` to keep track of the custom domain configured for a given GitHub Pages website.

One last example would be font files only referenced inside of CSS files, as Zine currently lacks the ability to inspect CSS files.

To install assets unconditionally, list them in `static_assets` in your `build.zig`:

***build.zig***
```zig
pub fn build(b: *std.Build) !void {
    zine.website(b, .{
        .title = "Zine - Static Site Generator",
        .host_url = "https://zine-ssg.io",
        .layouts_dir_path = "layouts",
        .content_dir_path = "content",
        .assets_dir_path = "assets",
        .static_assets = &.{
            // Used by GitHub Pages
            "CNAME",
            // This asset is referenced in some inlined HTML in Markdown
            // which Zine is not yet able to analyze so as a temporary
            // hack we mark it as a static asset.
            "vscode-autoformatting.mp4",

            // Font referenced in CSS files
            "BebasNeue-Regular.ttf",
        },
    });
} 
```

# [Page Assets]($section.id('page-assets'))
Page assets are the same as site assets, but are located inside of `content_dir_path`, next to the page that references them.

If you have an asset that is specific to only a single page of your website, you can conveniently place it next to it inside the content directory, but beware of respecting the expected content structure.

***shell***
```
content
├── blog
│   ├── first-post.smd
│   └── index.smd
└── index.smd
```

In Zine, pages that are not named `index.smd` (i.e. pages that don't define a section) must keep their assets under a directory with the same name.

***shell***
```
content
├── blog
│   ├── first-post
│   │   └── C.png
│   ├── first-post.smd
│   ├── B.png
│   └── index.smd
├── A.png
└── index.smd
```

- `A.png` belongs to `content/index.smd`
- `B.png` belongs to `content/blog/index.smd`
- `C.png` belongs to `content/blog/first-post.smd`

Note how `C.png` lives under `content/blog/first-post/` because it belongs to a non-section page.

Accessing a page asset in SuperHTML can be done using `$page.asset('C.png')`.
Like all assets, they must be `link`ed to be installed in the output directory.


In SuperMD you can reference page assets like so:
- `$link.asset()`
- `$image.asset()`
- etc

Since in SuperMD the default context is "the page", *page assets* are simply called *assets*.

# [Build Assets]($section.id('build-assets'))
If you have artifacts built using the Zig build system, you can use them in Zine by setting `build_assets` in your `build.zig`.

Accessing a build asset in SuperHTML can be done using `$build.asset('foo')`.
Like all assets, they must be `link`ed to be installed in the output directory.

In SuperMD you can reference build assets like so:
- `$link.buildAsset()`
- `$image.buildAsset()`
- etc

See the doc comments for `zine.BuildAsset` for more info.

# [Automatic Size Attributes]($section.id('autosize'))

To enable this feature, set `image_size_attributes = true` in your website's
`build.zig`.

When enabled, Zine will automatically add `height` and `width` attributes to
the generated `<img>` elements of local images embedded in SuperMD documents.

Doing so will mean that the browser will be able to know the size of all images
even before downloading them, completely removing the need for reflowing the
page, and overall giving the impression of a faster page load, especially if a
page has many heavy images in it.

## This feature has one big quirk

For some reason browsers will distort images that specify `height` and `width`
when resizing them to fit their parent element. You can fix this by applying
the following CSS "patch":
```css
img { height: auto; }
```

# Next Steps
- Read the [SuperHTML Scripty reference page](superhtml/scripty) page to know what operations are available for assets and other kinds of data in SuperHTML. 
  The [Assets section]($link.sibling('superhtml/scripty').ref('Asset')) might be of particular interest.

- Read the [SuperMD Scripty reference page](supermd/scripty) page to do the same relatively to SuperMD.
