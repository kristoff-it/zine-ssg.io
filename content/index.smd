## What is Zine?
A Zine site is a collection of content files and layouts.

Zine turns your content into HTML, styles it using your layouts, and finally
copies the result into an output directory that you can then publish on static
hosting services like GitHub Pages.

Zine uses a **structured approach to content authoring** that helps keeping sizeable
content collections manageable.

Zine is implemented from scratch in [Zig](https://ziglang.org) and it's so fast that it's currently able to give you instant live updates when the development server is running, even though it rebuilds your entire site from scratch every time. As a datapoint, this website rebuilds in `7ms` on a Mac Mini M2.

Cached rebuilds are planned and will implement **surgical
dependency tracking** to ensure minimal rebuilds, keeping the authoring experience
excellent at all scales.

*Zine is pronounced like in [fan**zine**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine)*.
    
## A handcrafted authoring experience
Zine uses [SuperMD]($link.page('docs/supermd')) for content and 
[SuperHTML]($link.page('docs/superhtml')) for defining layouts.

SuperMD is an extension of Markdown that allows you to **define embedded assets 
and semantic constructs that would be impossible to express in Markdown** without using inline HTML.

SuperHTML is an extension of HTML that focuses on expressing **correct templating
logic**. With SuperHTML it's **impossible to generate syntactically malformed HTML** and most
mistakes become **build time errors**.
