<h2>Warning</h2><p>Zine is currently alpha software.</p><p>Many features are missing and currently Zine is only capable of building relatively simple websites.</p><p>All the common features (like i18n, an asset system, etc) are planned, but will take some time to be implemented.</p><p>Using Zine today means participating in its development process.</p><h2>1. Get Zig</h2><p>Zine has only one dependency: the Zig compiler.</p><p>We currently track Zig's master branch so you will need to get an unstable build  from <a href="https://ziglang.org">the official website</a>. In the future Zine will pin to a tagged release of Zig, be it an official release <a href="https://devlog.hexops.com/2024/announcing-nominated-zig/">or not</a>.</p><h2>2. Clone Zine's Sample Site</h2><p>And what's a better sample site than the official site itself?</p><p><i><strong><code>shell</code></strong></i></p><pre><code class="bash"><span class="constant">$ git</span> <span class="constant">clone</span> <span class="constant">https://github.com/kristoff-it/zine-ssg.io.git</span>
<span class="constant">$ cd</span> <span class="constant">zine-ssg.io</span>
<span class="constant">$ zig</span> <span class="constant">build</span> <span class="constant">serve</span> <span class="constant">-Dport=8080</span>
</code></pre>
<p>After that, start hacking on it and see how Zine reacts!</p><h2>Next Steps</h2><p>To learn more about Zine, <a href="/documentation/">see the documentation section</a>.</p><p>See the <a href="/community/">Vision & Community section</a> to join our community.</p>
